JSON Web token Structure
It consists of three parts sep.. by dots
Header:
It has two parts: type of token, and signing algo.. like HMAC, SHA256 or RSA
{
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
}
This json is BASE64Url encoded

Payload:
Claims are the statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
There are three types of Claims: 
registered
iss(issuer), exp(expiration time), sub(subject), aud(audience), and others

public 
To avoid the collisions

private 
Custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them
and are neither registerd or public claims.

Example:
{
    "sub": "1230493",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "admin": true
}

Signature

HMACSHA256(
    base64UrlEncode(Header) + "." +
    base64UrlEncode(Payload),
    secret
)

It is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and in the 
case of tokens signed with a private keys, it can also verify that the sender
of the JWT is who it says it is.
